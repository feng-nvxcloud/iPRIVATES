# iPRIVATES
## Description:
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used for identifying potential risk variants in various diseases. A statistically meaningful GWAS typically requires a large sample size to detect disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). However, a single institution usually only possesses a limited number of samples. Therefore, cross-institutional partnerships are required to increase sample size and statistical power. However, cross-institutional partnerships offer significant challenges, a major one being data privacy. For example, the privacy awareness of people, the impact of data privacy leakages and the privacy-related risks are becoming increasingly important while there is no de-identification standard available to safeguard genomic data sharing.  We introduce a novel privacy-preserving federated GWAS framework (iPRIVATES). Equipped with privacy-preserving federated analysis, iPRIVATES enables multiple institutions to jointly perform GWAS analysis without leaking patient-level genotyping data. Only aggregated local statistics are exchanged within the study network.

## Requirement

* MATLAB2019b

## How to use

* set up IP and Port, use '0.0.0.0' if you want to run both client and server in local

* if use more than one clients, change num_clients in server script

## Note
* iPRIVATES was developed and tested under MATLAB2019b
